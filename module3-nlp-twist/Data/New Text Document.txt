To help us monitor our topic of interest which is topic 2, we built our dashboard using tableau. Data was queried from Mysql 
The dashboard tracks tracks on a daily basis, the number of tweets and retweets that are predicted to belong to topic 2. Importantly, 
we also have a normalized plot that shows the proportion of topic 2 to the total number of tweets in a day. The bottom part shows the 
top 10 tweets. The overview part gives quick info on the time of last query, number of tweets and retweets within the last 24 hours 
and a brief summary of our main insights gleaned from the results. Finally, we have added a button that links to the PyLDAvis model 
visualization. You may follow the link below to the published dashboard and model vis.


To conclude our presentation,
we have used nlp models to predict the main topics that may be gleaned from huge volumes of twitter data. We found that the model 
accuracy diminishes over time suggesting the need for frequent retrains. And we finished by building and deploying a dashboard for our results. Thank you
